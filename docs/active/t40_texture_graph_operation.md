# T40 TextureGraph Operation Authority

The active `texture-graph-operation` contribution owns the current TextureGraph
command identities. Every current contract reports
`texture-graph-operation-owner`; no namespace or catch-all fallback adds
commands.

The three typed node/link/parameter mutation identities are dormant compatibility
commands. Normal graph editing uses the public HJSON workspace flow below;
their compatibility registration does not make them generated named SDK methods.

The four typed mutation/settle commands and `texture_graph.artifact.bake` enter the common
Operation lifecycle through five request-scoped factories. The public handler
and typed capability contribution consume the same factory object for each
identity. Read-only `texture_graph.artifact.capture` and
`texture_graph.runtime.probe` enter the common Query lifecycle. These lanes
reuse the single native GraphCompound TextureGraph mechanics boundary. The
former AudioMediaGraph registry stage is an internal mechanics dependency only,
not a second public route, registry, handler, contract, test or documentation
authority.

Mutation and bake success require exact schema and target binding, native
application, settle, required persistence and independent readback. Bake
renders every selected output, creates the requested Texture2D targets as one
authorized impact set, and compensates the full batch on failure. Artifact
capture resolves the current settled asset on the server and returns the
selected output observations without publishing a second artifact authority.
Runtime probe performs a real render,
returns pixel statistics and expected-stat comparisons, and never persists.
Prewrite failures leave no residue;
unknown state requires reconciliation rather than replay.

## Public SDK and CLI

For an existing TextureGraph, obtain
`workspace = client.content_graph.export_workspace(...)`, edit its ordinary
HJSON files and call `workspace.import_changes()`. Discover current command
arguments through command usage. Edit the ordinary HJSON
graph files. Native scalar, integer, Boolean, string, color and vector inputs expose
their compact value, including inputs that are not graph parameters. Input parameters
also expose aliases when no compact native value is available. Connections refer to
the exported readable node and pin names. Import the same directory and
read its refreshed HJSON before the next edit. The shared importer resolves the workspace machine mapping;
callers do not read or rewrite it.
If an older export reports `semantic_workspace_graph_pin_capture_reexport_required`,
export to a new directory and transfer the intended ordinary HJSON edits. That
old machine baseline lost the original pin selectors; do not reconstruct them from aliases
or overwrite the directory containing unapplied edits.

Add a known expression with a keyed entry such as
`AddedGain: {name: "Scalar"}` in the graph's `nodes` object. Optional input values
and connections can be included in the same import. Unknown or ambiguous names
fail before mutation. Complete native-menu candidate search and semantic
`select` are not provided by this path. The old `uai.texture_graph.edit/1`
operation wrapper is retired; export a current workspace to edit it.

Editable expression fields use the shared reflected property surface in each
node's `properties.hjson`, except values already represented by compact inputs.
This includes `TG_Setting`, input references such as Texture `Source`, and
reflected input structures such as `OutputSettings.Settings`. Edit the exported `categories`
`type`/`value` rows; enum names and legal choices come from the workspace's
shared definitions. For example, an IfThenElse node exposes
`NoCategory.Operator: {type: "EIfThenElseOperator", value: "LT"}`. Import follows
the captured node identity through the same current binding used by nodes and
connections. If the graph edit replaces the expression, settings are prepared
against the replacement after native creation. ObjectApply validates and applies
the original descriptors and sends the native property notification so the
setting Pin stays synchronized.
A value has one writable projection. Compact native inputs retain their
alias/value surface; other reflected fields use the same recursive codec and
property application as settings. An input containing only `alias` edits that
alias and preserves its value. Native outputs/private data are not editable
inputs, and live GPU values are not converted into invented asset references.
Integer inputs preserve their native width through export, import and readback;
fractional or out-of-range numbers are diagnosed at the input instead of truncated.

Setting edits join the same transaction and complete expected readback as graph
edits. Invalid enum values fail before source mutation. A final-readback
rejection restores original dirty memory, package bytes, settings and graph.
Direct coverage includes IfThenElse settings and identity, Source references,
OutputSettings structure edits, alias-only changes, and exact ArrayGrid integer
inputs through public import and persistent reload. Other expressions and
interface-changing settings have not been exhaustively validated.

Workspace update success includes persistent reload and final HJSON readback
before the atomic transaction commits. If that final readback fails, the shared
transaction restores the pre-import graph, dirty state and original package
on disk. Typed compatibility operations retain their own lifecycle contract.


For a missing target, the same public import accepts an inline HJSON source
with the shared schema and a readable root factory candidate:

```hjson
{
  schema: uai.authoring.workspace/2
  root: {
    candidate: { name: "Texture Graph" }
    graph: {
      nodes: {
        Gain: {
          candidate: { name: "Scalar" }
          inputs: { Scalar: { alias: "Gain", value: 0.25 } }
        }
      }
      connections: []
    }
  }
}
```

Pass this text through `source: {kind: "inline", document: text}` and supply
the asset path as `target`. The server resolves the existing factory catalog
and initialization contract; no factory/class path or revision is required.
Native factory defaults, including the Output node, are preserved. The root
and requested graph content are created in one atomic transaction, saved and
reloaded before final readback. Invalid candidates or unsupported fields fail
before creating the target. A final-readback rejection restores the original
absence in memory, the asset registry and on disk. Export the new asset to a
fresh workspace for subsequent edits. This limited initialization uses the
existing expression-name resolver; it does not claim complete native menus.

The final manifest projects the active identities into the default
`texture_graph` namespace. Callers import only `uai`, use `uai.connect_project()` for the local project and call methods such as
`client.texture_graph.artifact_capture(...)`,
`client.texture_graph.artifact_bake(...)`,
`client.texture_graph.graph_validate_evaluate_settle(...)`, and
`client.texture_graph.runtime_probe(...)`. Named SDK calls and the thin CLI
consume the same generated catalog, Client, Protocol and Transport. No
T40-specific Python module remains authoritative.

```text
ueagentinterfacecmd exec texture_graph.artifact.capture --params-json '{"outputs":[{"element_id":"OutputNode","output_name":"Output"}],"target_ref":"/Game/TextureGraphs/TG_Example"}'
```

Use `client.query.command_search("capture texture graph artifact")` and
then `client.query.command_usage(...)` to obtain the minimal named SDK call.
Inspect available nested parameter schemas with `ueagentinterfacecmd describe <command-id> --parameter <name>` when needed; domain semantics remain in this contract. Target
revisions and other concurrency evidence are resolved, frozen, and rechecked by
the server during the operation; callers neither read nor write them.
